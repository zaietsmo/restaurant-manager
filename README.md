## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaietsmo/restaurant-manager.git
cd restaurant-manager
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS and Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables. Here's an example of what the `.env` file might look like:

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

**Note:** Replace `your-secret-key` with a secure secret key. In a production environment, ensure that `DEBUG` is set to `False` and configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` appropriately.

### 5. Apply Migrations

Create the necessary database tables:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Load Initial Data (Optional)

If you have a fixture (`dump.json`) with initial data, you can load it using:

```bash
python manage.py loaddata dump.json
```

### 7. Create a Superuser (Optional)

To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

### 8. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to access the application.
